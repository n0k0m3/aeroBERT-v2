"Each projecting object that would injure persons seated or moving about the airplane in normal flight must be padded.","0"
"High - speed airplanes must have recovery characteristics that do not result in structural damage or loss of control, beginning at any likely speed up to V _ MO / M _ MO, following a high - speed trim upset for airplanes where dynamic pressure can impair the longitudinal trim system operation.","2"
"The installed powerplant must operate without any hazardous characteristics during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations for the airplane and the engine.","2"
"Each flight recorder must be installed so that any single electrical failure external to the recorder does not disable both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.","0"
"The airplane structure must be strong enough to withstand the flight loads combined with pressure differential loads from zero up to the maximum relief valve setting.","0"
"Airplanes not certified for aerobatics must have dynamic short period and dutch roll stability in normal operations.","2"
"Each flight recorder must be installed so that it remains powered for as long as possible without jeopardizing emergency operation of the airplane.","0"
"The control surfaces must be designed for the limit loads resulting from the flight conditions in Sections 25 - 331, 25 - 341 ( a ) and ( b ), 25 - 349, and 25 - 351, considering the requirements for unsymmetrical loads, in Section 25 - 427.","0"
"Safety and survival equipment must be reliable, readily accessible, easily identifiable, and clearly marked to identify its method of operation.","0"
"A means to extinguish fire within a fire zone, except a combustion heater fire zone, must be provided for any fire zone located outside the pilot's view.","1"
"Insulation on electrical wire and electrical cable must be self - extinguishing.","1"
"The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim during a climb with maximum continuous power at a speed not more than 1. 3 V _ SR1, with the landing gear retracted, and the flaps in the takeoff position.","2"
"The airplane must be safely controllable and maneuverable during level flight.","2"
"Indication systems that integrate the display of flight or powerplant parameters to operate the airplane or are required by the operating rules of this chapter must in combination with other systems, be designed and installed so information essential for continued safe flight and landing will be available to the flightcrew in a timely manner after any single failure or probable combination of failures.","0"
"The airplane, even when damaged in an emergency landing, must protect each occupant against injury that would preclude egress when the occupant experiences ultimate static inertia loads likely to occur in an emergency landing.","1"
"For high - speed airplanes and all airplanes with a maximum operating altitude greater than 25, 000 feet ( 7, 620 meters ) pressure altitude, there must be no perceptible buffeting in cruise configuration at 1g and at any speed up to V _ MO / M _ MO, except stall buffeting.","2"
"Each cockpit voice recorder shall record voice communications of flightcrew members on the flight deck, using the airplane's interphone system.","1"
"No airplane may exhibit any divergent longitudinal stability characteristic so unstable as to increase the pilot's workload or otherwise endanger the airplane and its occupants.","2"
"The microphone must be so located and, if necessary, the preamplifiers and filters of the recorder must be so adjusted or supplemented, so that the intelligibility of the recorded communications is as high as practicable when recorded under flight cockpit noise conditions and played back.","2"
"Secondary controls, such as wheel brake, spoiler, and tab controls, must be designed for the maximum forces that a pilot is likely to apply to those controls.","0"
"Doors, canopies, and exits must be protected against inadvertent opening in flight, unless shown to create no hazard when opened in flight.","0"
"A means to extinguish fire within a fire zone, except a combustion heater fire zone, must be provided for any fire zone embedded within the fuselage, which must also include a redundant means to extinguish fire.","1"
"Trim tab controls must be irreversible unless the tab is appropriately balanced and shown to be free from flutter.","0"
"The airplane must be designed for the unsymmetrical loads resulting from the failure of the critical engine.","0"
"The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim without further force upon, or movement of, the primary flight controls or corresponding trim controls by the pilot, or the flight control system during level flight.","1"
"Thermal / acoustic materials in the fuselage, must not be a flame propagation hazard.","1"
"Each flight recorder must be installed so that except for recorders powered solely by the engine - driven electrical generator system, there is an automatic means to simultaneously stop a recorder that has a data erasure feature and prevent each erasure feature from functioning, within 10 minutes after crash impact.","1"
"Unless the failure of an automatic power or thrust control system is extremely remote, the system must provide a means for the flightcrew to verify the system is in an operating condition.","1"
"Each non - ejectable record container must be located and mounted so as to minimize the probability of container rupture resulting from crash impact and subsequent damage to the record from fire.","0"
"The aircraft shall supply directional data to the flight recorder.","1"
